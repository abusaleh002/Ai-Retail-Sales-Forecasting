# üõí AI-Powered Retail Sales Forecasting

This project explores and compares several machine learning and deep learning models to forecast product-level retail sales. The goal is to identify the most effective forecasting approach using a combination of classical time series models, recurrent neural networks (LSTM & GRU), and XGBoost with extensive feature engineering.

## üß† Models Compared

- **LSTM** (1 to 4 layers, various units, ReLU/Tanh)
- **GRU** (1 to 4 layers, tuned for depth)
- **ARIMA** (optimized via grid search)
- **SARIMA** (seasonal ARIMA with multiple seasonal orders)
- **XGBoost** (boosted tree model with tuned hyperparameters)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques Used

- Lag features (up to 14 days)
- Rolling statistics (mean, std)
- Time-based features (day, month, weekend)
- External pricing & promotion signals
- Outlier clipping using quantiles
- Robust, Standard, and MinMax Scalers
- Hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna**
